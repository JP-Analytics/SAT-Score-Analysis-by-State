# SAT Scores Analysis by State

## üìå Overview

This project analyzes the average SAT scores across U.S. states, using R for data manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and factors influencing SAT performance. The analysis includes data visualization techniques, predictive modeling, and exploratory data analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Data visualization using ggplot2

- Predictive modeling of SAT scores

- Identification of states that overperform or underperform based on expected SAT scores

- Exploration of potential factors influencing SAT performance

## Installation

To run this analysis, you need R and RStudio installed. The required R packages include:


```r
install.packages("Sleuth3")   # Provides datasets
install.packages("ggplot2")   # Data visualization
install.packages("dplyr")     # Data manipulation
install.packages("ggrepel")   # Improved text labeling in plots

```

## Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SAT_Scores_Analysis.git

Open SAT_Scores_Analys.Rmd in RStudio.

Run the code chunks to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

Knit the document to generate a report.

## üìä Next Steps

- Improve the predictive model by incorporating more variables.

- Perform additional hypothesis testing on SAT score correlations.

- Explore external datasets for deeper insights into educational factors.
